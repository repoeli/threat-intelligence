# Quality Gate Checklist

## Current Status: 46% Coverage ❌
- **Target:** 90% coverage required
- **Current:** 46% coverage  
- **Gap:** Need +44% coverage

## Immediate Actions Required:

### 1. Install and Configure Coverage Tools ✅
- [x] pytest-cov installed and working

### 2. Focus Areas for Coverage Improvement:
- **backend/app/main.py:** 38% → 80%+ (Missing: auth endpoints, error handling)
- **backend/app/services/threat_analysis.py:** 22% → 80%+ (Missing: service methods)
- **backend/app/auth.py:** 64% → 80%+ (Missing: edge cases)

### 3. Remove/Fix Non-Working Tests:
- Remove tests that expect non-existent endpoints
- Fix validation issues causing 422 errors
- Focus on testing actual implementation

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks (Next Phase):
- black (code formatting)
- isort (import sorting)  
- flake8 (linting)
- mypy (type checking)

## Success Criteria:
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Quality gate failing CI if coverage drops below 90%
