# Authentication Status Check

## Current Issue Analysis

Based on the browser console output:

```
🔐 Login response: {message: 'Login successful', user: {...}, token: {...}}
```

### Problem Identified

1. **Backend Response Format**: The backend is still returning the old nested format:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Login successful",
     "user": {...},
     "token": {
       "access_token": "...",
       "token_type": "bearer",
       "expires_in": 1440
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Frontend Expectation**: The frontend expects:
   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "...",
     "token_type": "bearer", 
     "expires_in": 1440,
     "user": {...}
   }
   ```

### Frontend Fix Applied ✅

I've updated the frontend login/register functions to handle both formats:

```typescript
// Handle both old and new response formats
const access_token = response.access_token || response.token?.access_token;
const user = response.user;
```

### Backend Issue 🔧

The backend changes I made didn't take effect because **the backend server needs to be restarted**.

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Restart Backend Server (Recommended)
1. Stop the current backend server (Ctrl+C)
2. Restart it with: `python start_server.py` 
3. The new response format should then work

### Option 2: Current Workaround (Should work now)
The frontend fix should now work with the current backend response format.

## Test Instructions

**Try logging in again now**. You should see:
1. ✅ Token gets extracted from `response.token.access_token`
2. ✅ Token gets stored in localStorage
3. ✅ Subsequent requests include the Authorization header
4. ✅ Protected endpoints return 200 instead of 401

The console should show:
```
✅ Token stored: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJ...
✅ User stored: {user_id: "...", email: "...", ...}
🔐 Adding auth token to request: /analyze/stats Token: eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...
```

## Expected Result

After this fix, authentication should work correctly and you should be able to access:
- ✅ Dashboard page  
- ✅ Analysis page
- ✅ History page

Without getting 401 Unauthorized errors.
